# Data Structures in C/C++

This repository contains various data structures implemented in C/C++.

## List of Data Structures

- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Graph**: Basic graph structures and algorithms.
- **Leftist Heap**: A priority queue implemented with a leftist tree.
- **Priority Queue**: An abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure in which each element has a certain priority.
- **Binary Tree**: Basic binary tree implementation.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list in which the last node points back to the first node.
- **Linear Linked List**: A sequence of elements, each containing a reference to the next element.
- **Queue**: A collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end and the removal from the other end.
- **Splay Tree**: A self-adjusting binary search tree.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
